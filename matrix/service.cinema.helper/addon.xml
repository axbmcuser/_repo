		<news>[B]2.0.14[/B] (2023-01-15)

- Code and performance optimizations

[B]2.0.13[/B] (2022-12-31)

- Removed unused code (Skin Reload functionality)
- On Kodi 17, don't check for Window.IsVisible(OsdSubtitleSettings) since this dialog is non existant
- Added multi-version check for upcoming Kodi 21

[B]2.0.12[/B] (2022-12-30)
[B]2.0.11[/B] (2022-12-30)

- Improvements for FullScreen OSD auto-close functionality and skin detection

[B]2.0.10[/B] (2022-12-25)
[B]2.0.9[/B] (2022-12-25)

- Added new property (home) CinemaHelper.player.DBID

[B]2.0.8[/B] (2022-12-24)

- Added support for new service.listitem.helper setting "videolibrary.itemseparator" needed for value splitting if user has set a custom separator via advancedsettings.xml
- Added PostCreditsScene detection mechanism
- Added VideoPlayer.studio splitting support
- Added support for custom view IDs via Skin Settings option "Customize View IDs for "Always force Preset Views""

New properties:

(home) CinemaHelper.player.studio.X (X=index no, starting at 1)
(home) CinemaHelper.player.nearEndPreReached
(home) CinemaHelper.player.nearEndReached
(home) CinemaHelper.player.movieHasPostCreditsScene

[B]2.0.7[/B] (2022-12-10)

- TV show episodes now always focus first item after window open. Much better OOB experience, not only because KODI 17 has a focus history bug for episodes view, but in general.

[B]2.0.6[/B] (2022-12-04)

- Set "ExperimentalPostMovieDialogOpensNow" property before opening post movie dialogs

[B]2.0.5[/B] (2022-12-03)

- Rename "Special Lists" playlist folders again for more simplicity (Android "â€“"/"-" workaround removed). "service.cinema.helper" had also to be changed accordingly.

[B]2.0.4[/B] (2022-12-03)

- Added KODI 19+20 (Python 3) compatibility code basis (Dual-addon: Python 2 still supported)
- - Python 2/3 versions still need separate addon version due to required addon.xml changes
- - Using unified code basis still makes things much easier

[B]1.0.3[/B] (2022-12-02)

- Change VideoOSD idle-auto-close handling for Kodi 18 or higher (Seemingly a "Window.IsTopMost" bug on Kodi 18)
- Fix duplicate tmpKodiIdleTime check for VideoOSD idle-auto-close (did no harm, but fixed nonetheless)
- Improve clearing of CinemaHelper.UserRating.PROCESS and CinemaHelper.WatchedState.PROCESS
- Remove "True or IsVideoDb" debug condition (condition is now removed)
- Fix unmatched parentheses for "IsSpecialList" definition

[B]1.0.2[/B] (2022-04-06)

- Fix "ExperimentalPostMovieInfoDialog" enabled-check

[B]1.0.1[/B] (2022-04-06)

- Added "ParentFolderItem skip for Fanart view" functionality
- Added "Always force Preset Views" functionality
- Added different code execution intervals for different actions
- Code and performance improvements
