		<news>[B]5.4.20[/B] (2023-01-01)

- [DialogSeekBar] Added Player.HasPerformedSeek(2) because Player.DisplayAfterSeek is removed for Kodi 20

[B]5.4.19[/B] (2022-12-31)

- Improved full screen info/osd visual condition for very rare case of playing videos without audio track (and therefore empty VideoPlayer.AudioLanguage property)

- Removed some bottom item counts for PVR dialogs (Affects "Timer rules" and more)

- [VideoFullScreen] Minor improvements, including: Cohesive picon fadetime, added missing VisibleFadeEffect for SubtitlesLanguage, added missing VideoPlayer.SubtitlesEnabled condition for Kodi 18+ (does no harm on 17 also)
- [_variables] Minor improvements, including: Corrected conditions/brackets for VideoPlayer.AudioLanguage and VideoPlayer.SubtitlesLanguage
- [Includes] Remove unused SelectLabel

[B]5.4.18[/B] (2022-12-30)

- Instant Hotfix for code merging/syntax error issue

[B]5.4.17[/B] (2022-12-30)

- Improve VideoFullScreen buffering indicator conditions

Reworked FullScreen Info/OSD for much more simplicity (Rework includes all sections: Movies, TV Show Episodes, Videos, Music)
Corresponding new Skin setting:
Skin settings -> OSD + Dialogs -> "Reduced Fullscreen Info OSD   (Default: On)"

- Added new "DefaultTV" icon for PVR dialogs (mostly used as fallback for missing channel icons. Default video icon - which was used before - was kinda unfitting)

- Reworked/improved most PVR dialogs
Including the following changes:
- - Channel icons now always on the left side within lists)
- - Fixed plot values regarding line breaks issues of EpisodeName
- - Improved plot values regarding duplicate properties of EpisodeName and Plot itself (show only one property in such cases)

- [Custom_1107_SearchDialog] Updated Prime Video Search including a new icon (Visible if Kodi Netflix add-on is installed)

- [_includes] Added a few additional VideoPlayer.AudioLanguage/SubtitlesLanguage conditions for Kodi DSPlayer/KodiDS

- [MyMusicPlaylistEditor] Slight improvements to visuals and font styles (Could use some more work)

- [VideoFullScreen] Removed unused AudioDSP entries (deprecated)

- [IncludesPVR] Removed unused View Change button for PVR SideBlade

- [VideoFullScreen] [DialogVolumeBar] Fix rare Mute Label y-position condition

[B]5.4.15[/B] (2022-12-24)

- Expanded Skin Settings feature: When "Always force Preset Views" in "General Settings" is enabled, you can now customize the IDs in "Advanced Settings"

- New feature/Skin setting: "Use highest score for stars rating (*****)   (Default: On)" for DialogVideoInfo
This option will automatically convert+compare all available ratings (local and external) and always render the stars rating according to the highest of all scores, so that movies don't look worse on first sight than they might are.

- Skin setting change: Home screen options -> "Date/Time type" now defaults to "Time only" (Before: "Date + Time")
- - Additional corresponding change: Time is now at most exlusively displayed on Home screen or VideoFullScreen/MusicVisualisation regardless of the above mentioned setting. (No display on any further dialogs) Changed for simplicity and coherence.
! Attention: Please re-check your desired setting for this option after this change.

- New feature "PostCreditsScene detection" (supported by service.cinema.helper):
This feature now shows the (reworked) post credits scene "stinger" icon in [VideoFullscreen] when movie progress is within the final 30 minutes. Just open the VideoFullscreen Info or VideoOSD itself and look right besides "End time". Functioanlity depends on the common movie tags aftercreditsstinger/duringcreditsstinger and is enabled by default.
Additionally, you can activate a corresponding new Skin setting: OSD + Dialogs -> Video OSD / Fullscreen -> "Show Post Credits Scene Icon (10min before movie ends)   (Default: Off)" which shows the same icon on top of the playing movie once for some seconds, exactly 10 minutes before movie ends. This additional setting is optional and disabled by default.

- Skin Settings visually improved, reorganized and simplified (new tab "OSD + Dialogs", renamed "Experimental" to "Advanced settings")

- New Skin Setting: OSD + Dialogs -> Video Info Dialog -> "Use highest score for stars rating (*****)   (Default: On)"
(Service+skin will convert+compare all available ratings (local and external) and always render the stars rating according to the highest of all scores, so that movies don't look worse on first sight than they might are.)

- Improved Out Of The Box Experience: When loading a TV show Episodes dialog window, the first episode will always be selected. This workarounds/fixes the KODI selection-history bug which otherwise would result in poor user experience in this regard. (Supported by service.cinema.helper)


Additional changes:

- Keyboard/remote shortcuts on Video OSD: When focusing the buttons "subtitle" or "audio settings", pressing DOWN on your remote/keyboard triggers "NextSubtitle" and "NextAudioLanguage" for quick cycling.

Features:

If enabled, the episode thumbnail will be replaced by the TV Show Fanart
