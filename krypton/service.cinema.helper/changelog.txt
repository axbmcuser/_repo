[B]1.0.7[/B] (2022-12-10)

- TV show episodes now always focus first item after window open. Much better OOB experience, not only because KODI 17 has a focus history bug for episodes view, but in general.

[B]1.0.6[/B] (2022-12-04)

- Set "ExperimentalPostMovieDialogOpensNow" property before opening post movie dialogs

[B]1.0.5[/B] (2022-12-03)

- Rename "Special Lists" playlist folders again for more simplicity (Android "â€“"/"-" workaround removed). "service.cinema.helper" had also to be changed accordingly.

[B]1.0.4[/B] (2022-12-03)

- Added KODI 19+20 (Python 3) compatibility code basis (Dual-addon: Python 2 still supported)

- - Using unified code basis still makes things much easier
